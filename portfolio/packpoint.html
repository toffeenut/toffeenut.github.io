	Given extreme flexibility, I was asked to come up with a design for an app that 'packs your bag based on the weather'. With the rare chance to be in complete control, I started from bullet points, proceeded to sketches and wireframes, designed the mocks-ups, and finally prepared the production-ready assets.
	<br><br>
	Days after its iOS release, it was featured as one of Apple's Best New Apps.
	<br><br>
	Also available on Google Play, PackPoint was prepared for Android and its many screen resolutions. Soon, it will also be released for the iPad and various Android tablets.
