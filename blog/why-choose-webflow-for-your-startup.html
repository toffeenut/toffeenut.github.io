There’s Squarespace, Wix, and the ever-popular WordPress. Sadly, these platforms would either have conventional templates, limited features, messy backends, or all of the above. For you to build, maximize, and maintain an elaborate website in these website builders, custom coding is becoming the go-to way. But, it turns the needed solution into a workaround, which results in an unsustainable low-impact website.

It’s no surprise that brands and businesses, like <a href="https://webflow.com/customers/rakuten">Rakuten</a>, <a href="https://webflow.com/customers/angellist">AngelList</a>, <a href="https://webflow.com/customers/dell">Dell</a>, and <a href="https://webflow.com/customers">many more</a>, are making a switch from these usual platforms to an easier and more efficient alternative. Here are reasons why your start-up should too:</div>
        </div>
        <div class="content-wrapper"><img src="../images/nocode.gif" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-3">
          <div class="caption">

          </div>
          <h6 class="heading-6 black">1. <strong>Low-code or no-code experience? No problem.</strong></h6>
          <div class="body-text black">Other website builders offer pre-made templates you can customize for your project. But in the process, it forces your brand to fit into these cookie-cutter molds. And at the same time, it increases the risks of other brands in different industries finding the same template you used and customizing that for their own. Editing the code of a template to showcase the design you want is complicated and requires installing a crazy amount of plugins. This would result in troublesome maintenance, regular system updates, and latency issues with your website. And that’s on top of the grueling development process your team would go through. Building your start-up’s website on Webflow enables you to stand out versus your competitors, lessens the development time of your project, and utilizes your developers to more technical expansions of your business.</div>
          <div class="body-text black">Webflow took the template game along with the drag-and-drop option of most platforms to the next level. It allows users to create their plan the exact way they crafted it on paper without knowing how to deal with codes or be limited with templates. From simple landing pages, data-heavy lead generating forms to full-on e-commerce sites with memberships and payments, all of these are possible and more. Webflow’s tools enable you to mix and match elements, all code-free. This makes it easier for your developers to solely utilize their talents to develop more technical apps and your marketing team to do content without going through hoops just to achieve it.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="content-wrapper">
          <h6 class="heading-6 black">2. <strong>It’s user-friendly.</strong></h6>
          <div class="body-text black">Website builders like WordPress offer plenty of features on the backend but it becomes difficult to figure out which of these would work best for you and your brand.<br><br>Webflow’s straightforward dashboard interface makes plotting designs, editing layouts, managing elements, and publishing content on your website simple and easy. All your team needs to do is type in the name of your website onto your browser and add “<em>?edit”</em> at the end: <a href="http://yourwebsite.com/?edit"><strong><em>yourwebsite.com/?edit</em></strong></a>. This would allow you and other collaborators to access the content management system directly and seamlessly. And through that, manipulate the blend of texts and image contents directly on the actual layout your customers would be seeing when it’s published.</div><img src="../images/office.gif" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-3">

          <h6 class="heading-6 black">3. <strong>Built-In SEO</strong></h6>
          <div class="body-text black">Most people are not familiar with the concept of Search Engine Optimization unless they’re directly involved with it. Webflow offers tools that can simplify the SEO woes your team is worried about. There’s no need to craft your content to just cater to your site’s SEO, have engineers control your content for it, or install plugins to boost your website traffic. Webflow’s fine-tuned controls, indexing rules, metatags, and all those whatnots have that covered for you. In fact, there are some <a href="https://webflow.com/customers" target="_blank">case studies</a> of <a href="https://webflow.com/blog/kisi-and-webflow-seo" target="_blank">brands</a> that built or migrated their website to Webflow and showcased an organic increase in site traffic.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="content-wrapper">
          <h6 class="heading-6 black">4. <strong>Quality options for you and your customers.</strong></h6>
          <div class="body-text black">There are different ways to build your business’s online presence. A simple website. Product landing pages that are either static or interactive for your customers. Customized e-commerce marketplace fully equipped with self-reliant memberships and payment systems. Maybe your business involves creatives and you need to curate a portfolio for future clients to see or it deals with marketing data and needs sales and lead generating forms. Perhaps, you need to prototype a mobile app design. Whatever it is you need to accomplish, Webflow can deliver these quality outputs that are responsive to the different devices available, all without sacrificing the simplicity of the process and quality of your brand.</div><img src="../images/webfloweditor.gif" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-4">

          <div class="body-text black">When we say Webflow is user-friendly, it literally means that. There are no frills or clickbait to that statement.<strong> </strong>Anyone looking to try Webflow for the first time would find the platform welcoming.

          <h6 class="heading-6 black">7. <strong>Developer-dependent no more!</strong></h6>
          <div class="body-text black">There’s inevitably a need to update or maybe even tweak some parts of the layout when you’re managing a website. When this happens a content team’s go-to step is to contact their web developer and have them do these updates for them. This means downtime for the website for who knows how long. Through Webflow, your website could be built on a modular design system making it easier to scale elements internally. With this, your marketing teams would no longer need to rely on developers to update the contents of your site. There’s also no need to delegate a task to a developer when you and your team are empowered to do it easily with the simple tools you have. Doing this not only lessens the downtime for your site but also lowers the risk of loss for your business during that time.</div>

          <h6 class="heading-6 black">8. <strong>Website Security</strong></h6>
          <div class="body-text black">With Webflow there’s no need to install third-party plugins for encryptions because they automatically patch up your website with SSL certificates and update it frequently themselves, resulting in less if not zero maintenance on your part. Webflow has also put in place Advanced DDOS protection measures in their system to help prevent digital security attacks.<br><br>Security should be part of the website-building process and not an option you just add. Since Webflow is a relatively new platform in the game, security issues website builders in the past and the current problems they have encountered are taken into account in their system. Although nothing is 100% foolproof on the Internet, being <a href="https://sucuri.net/reports/2019-hacked-website-report/" target="_blank">the most popular</a> does not always equate to being the most secure option. As everyone is familiar with how its back process works, hackers would know the holes they can break into and attack your website easier than that of a less popular alternative.</div>

        <div class="content-wrapper">
          <h6 class="heading-6 black">9. <strong>Webflow is Extensible</strong></h6>
          <div class="body-text black">In the process of creating your start-up’s website, your team could reach a limit when you want to create something difficult to execute even with the resources available to you. This doesn’t mean you failed and can’t finish the project. Apart from being easy to use and boasting a no-code interface, it’s possible to adjust your website with custom coding and not in a temporary patchwork fix kind of way. You can hire someone to help set up a website in the most client-friendly way, where you or your team can later expand, update and build on your own. The possibilities with Webflow are endless as it’s extensible. You can create a basic website for a project and use that as a starting point for all other projects you plan to do. You can even have an external designer create a website that can be white-labeled by your business.</div><img src="../images/easy.gif" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-3">
